A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/atzedent/pen/WNyzRyx](https://codepen.io/atzedent/pen/WNyzRyx).

Here again different techniques and themes are at work. Transparency, especially the glass effect, atmospheric glow, smooth unification and two curve functions for animation. Some based on techniques that have been presented in this way or in variation by various programmers at European demo parties. 

Representative for all others is Antoine Zanuttini (NuSan). https://www.youtube.com/@NuSan_fx
